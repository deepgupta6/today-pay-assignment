React-Based Trivia Quiz Application
This document provides a comprehensive overview of an advanced trivia quiz application developed utilizing the React framework. The project is engineered to deliver a sophisticated and interactive user experience, underscored by a clean user interface, fluid animations, and robust state management protocols.

‚ú® Core Functionalities
The application is equipped with a comprehensive suite of features designed to ensure robustness, user-friendliness, and operational resilience.

Gameplay Mechanics
Dynamic Retrieval of Questions: Questions are dynamically fetched in real-time from the public Trivia API.

Configurable Difficulty Levels: Users are provided with the option to select from multiple difficulty tiers‚Äîspecifically Easy, Medium, and Hard‚Äîto customize the level of challenge.

Time-Constrained Questioning: Each question is accompanied by a 30-second response timer. The visual representation of the timer transitions in color from green to yellow and subsequently to red to indicate diminishing time.

Performance Scoring: The user's score is incrementally updated upon the submission of each correct answer.

Question Omission Capability: The application permits users to bypass any question they elect not to answer.

Comprehensive Results Summary: Upon completion of the quiz, a detailed results screen is presented, which displays the final score, the calculated percentage of correct answers, and a review of all submitted responses.

User Interface and Experience Enhancements
Contemporary and Responsive User Interface: The interface has been constructed with Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean, responsive design that maintains integrity across a wide range of devices and screen dimensions.

Fluid User Interface Animations: Leveraging the Framer Motion library, the user interface incorporates fluid animations for question transitions, interactive element feedback, and asynchronous loading states.

Visual Response Indicators: Icons from the Lucide React library are utilized to provide immediate and unambiguous visual confirmation for both correct and incorrect answer selections.

Optimized Layout Design: A professional and intuitive layout has been implemented to facilitate seamless user navigation throughout the quiz experience.

Technical Specifications and Exception Handling
API Communication Fallback Mechanism: In the event that the live API becomes unresponsive or exceeds an eight-second timeout threshold, the application is designed to transition seamlessly to a locally stored set of sample questions.

Selectable Data Source: A toggle control on the initial screen grants users the ability to manually alternate between the live API and the local data source.

Persistence of High Scores: The highest achieved score is preserved in the browser's localStorage, enabling users to benchmark their performance against previous sessions.

Session State Persistence: Should a page refresh occur during an active quiz, the application's current state‚Äîincluding the active question, score, and submitted answers‚Äîis restored via sessionStorage to prevent any loss of progress.

Asynchronous Operation States: The application displays a designated loading indicator during data-fetching operations and presents clear error notifications in the event of a technical issue.

Accessibility Standards: The application incorporates ARIA labels and live regions to enhance compatibility with screen reader technologies and improve the overall user experience for individuals with disabilities.
